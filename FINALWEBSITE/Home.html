		<h2> Philosophy </h2>
		<p> Our philosophy comes from a deep understanding of each individual’s power to create their own world. We thrive to develop this secret through sport-for-development programs with the benefit of learning more English </p>

<div class="HomeContent1">
	<p> Here at FIGHT<span class="RED"><strong>4</strong></span>KNOWLEDGE we teach any level of English upwards and guarantee at least one level advancement after the 8 week period. We achieve this by using sport as a tool for learning.</p>

<div class="HomeContent2">
	<p> Through the power of language you will learn about yourself and begin to put dreams into practice   </p>

<div class="HomeContent3">
	<p>  Physical exercise is good for mind, body and spirit. Furthermore,  sport is good for learning accountability, dedication, and leadership, among many other traits. Putting it all together by playing sport is a winning combination.  </p>
</div>
<div class="HomeContent4">
	<p>   Sport requires memorization, repetition and learning — skillsets that are directly relevant to classwork. Also, the determination and goal-setting skills sports require can be transferred to the classroom. </p>
</div>
<div class="HomeContent5">
	<p>  Fighting for a common goal with a host of other players, coaches, managers and community members teaches you how to build a collective team synergy and effectively communicate the best way to solve problems. This will be very helpful in life when encountering problems at work, at home, or in any arena. </p>
